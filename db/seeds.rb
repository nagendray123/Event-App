# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# 10.times do |i|
#   Event.create(
#     event_name: "Dance #{i+1}",
#     event_description: "Description of Dance #{i+1}",
#     date: Date.today,
#     time: Time.now,
#     location: "Bhopal #{i+1}"
#   )
# end
